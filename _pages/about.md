## Mission statement
1. Here I record and share my personal learning journey.
2. Visitors will find content focused on finance, economics and general data science.
3. Posts will be as practical as possible, offering code examples whenever it is useful.
4. Get feedback wherever and whenever possible.
5. Mistakes can be made but will always the corrected.

## Why this blog?
The year is 2020. My last encounter with formal education is already 3 years past, but since earning a masters degree in economics and starting a career outside of academia, I feel that I have never truly stopped studying. Many of my colleagues will agree with me: Lifelong learning is the new norm for workers these days.

The continuous technological progress demands an increasing connection between education and employment. While buzzwords like "AI", "machine learning" and so forth might be overused at times, it is undoubtedly true that many processes across industries will be eventually solved by machines instead of humans.

What does this mean for me and you? To stay ahead of the curve, one has to get to know ones future replacement - the computer program. Hence, a solid foundation in programming concepts and practice are some of the keys to a successful career in any field these days. And because the technological possibilities are improving fast, the few coding we learn in school might not be relevant anymore in a few years. Being a life-long learner, while essential for staying future-proof, can be fun, challenging and a great character strength to show to any employer. As [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/02/06/discover-the-global-trends-impacting-your-career) puts it, "Companies are embracing learning as a core skill, as technological change demands stronger and more continuous connections between education and employment."

As a trained economist with work experience in the financial services sector, I have set myself a goal to create more commitment to lifelong learning in my fields by writing about key concepts on my journey and sharing it on an open platform. The focus for this blog will be on topics I have encountered in my work and studies, with a look towards practical coding solutions in popular languages such as Python, R and SQL.

So, with that out of the way, let's get started and **"Hello world"**!
